				<h3>Submit an issue</h3>

				<p>
					This is probably the most pragmatic option for most people. <a
						href="https://github.com/login"
						title="Log into Github.">Log into Github</a
					>
					and
					<a
						href="https://github.com/wilhelm-murdoch/plantsm.art/issues/new"
						title="Submit a new issue.">submit a new issue</a
					>. Be sure to add a detailed title, description and — most importantly — ensure you’ve
					selected an appropriate tag to associate with the issue. This allows me to quickly sort
					though and prioritise other entries.
				</p>

				<h3>Fork the project</h3>

				<p>
					If you’d like to get your hands dirty with the source code, or update the plant database
					yourself with new records and images, feel free to <a
						href="https://github.com/wilhelm-murdoch/plantsm.art/fork"
						title="Fork the repository.">fork the repository</a
					>
					yourself and
					<a
						href="https://github.com/wilhelm-murdoch/plantsm.art/compare"
						title="Submit a pull request.">submit a pull request</a
					> when you’re finished.
				</p>

				<p>
					All changes are peer-reviewed before merging into the <code>main</code> branch and
					deploying to production. If your change is approved, you’ll automatically show up in the
					<a href="#contributors" title="Contributors">contributors' list</a> below. 🙂
				</p>

				<h3>Shoot me a message</h3>

				<p>
					If you’d rather not go through the hassle of dealing with Github, feel free to fire off a
					message to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/wilhelm" title="Wilhelm's Twitter account."
						>Twitter</a
					> and I’ll try to get back to you as soon as I’m able.
				</p>

				<h3>Buy me a ☕️!</h3>

				<p>
					By design, operational costs are pretty low for this service. At the moment, I only pay to
					renew the domain name. But, I do spend a lot of my free time maintaining the site. If you
					value this service and want to help out in some small way, feel free to send me the gift
					of caffeine via my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/devilmaycode" title="My Ko-fi account."
						>Ko-fi account</a
					>. Any amount is greatly appreciated!
